## Requirements

- a `git` client installed
- `nodejs` (v18.19.0 LTS), `npm` and `yarn` installed
- optional, but useful: an IDE (Visual Code for example)

## Quick start

1. run `yarn` in the project directory.
2. run `npm run start-devnet` fot the `Devnet` network.
3. optionally make edits to `networks` or other configurations found in newly created `index.ts` in the `src/config` folder.

- One can use any of the existing network setups by running one of the `npm run start-*` scripts available in the `package.json` file.
- Or, alternatively copy one of the config files ( for ex. `/src/config/config.devnet.ts` ) to a new file `/src/config/index.ts`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#building-the-app) for more information.

### `npm run prepare-free-icons`

Use the Free version of the Fontawesome Icons ( used by default ) ( no paid plan necessary )

### `npm run prepare-pro-icons`

Prepare the Pro version of the Fontawesome Icons ( a paid plan for Fontawesome is needed )
If you already have a fontawesome accessToken, you will either have to either:

- set a `.npmrc` file with only the `_authToken`, without the `registry` ( the `.npmrc` file is already added in the `.gitignore` file)
- run `npm config set "//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken" FONT-AWESOME-PACKAGE-TOKEN`

See more on Fontawesome's [Using A Package Manager](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/packages) page.
